            <p align="justify">Creative. That's who you are. Your art matters and it deserves to be seen. It’s that intensity of emotion that keeps<br>
              you at it. Because this is a world where success is not measured simply by how much money you earn, but by your<br>
              ability to merge work, play and talent into one fantastic lifestyle. It starts right here with us.</p>
            <p align="justify">You’ll be part of a creative community, inspired by the people around you and working with students from every<br>
          discipline in Creative Industries to bring your ideas alive. </p>
